# SSH Brute Force

1 to 1 Brute Force of SSH Credentials from 10.102.5.7 to 10.102.2.10 on port 22.

SSH is encrypted so you can plainly see the hallmarks of the password or username being changed. But using this PCAP you CAN use the length of the sessions in time and or bytes to identify a failed logon session vs. a successful one.
